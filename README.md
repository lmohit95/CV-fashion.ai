The VGG-19 folder contains the transfer learning implementation. Any alternate content and style images can be provided in NeuralStyleTransfer class. The NeuralStyleTransfer 
class needs to be run to start the training process. 
Hyperparmeters like learning rate, beta and epsilon values can be altered in NeuralStyleTransfer class.

GAN implementations are provided in GAN directory. cGan.py consists of Conditional GAN implementation. 
wcGAN.py consists of Wesserstein Conditional GAN implementation. test.py consists of the test code which runs on test images.

Sample test images are provided in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Du2CrYbcEZjkdP3xmXnstjOfaq_UQPnE/view?usp=sharing.

Training set for GAN implementations can be found here
